# Pattern-Based Event Sequence Matching Framework

## Overview

This repository contains a framework for **pattern-based event sequence matching** and **pattern inference**. It is designed for exploring complex event processing (CEP) patterns over streaming data using genetic algorithms to infer optimal patterns based on a target dataset.

The project leverages **Apache Flink CEP** for event processing and the **JGEA (Java Genetic Evolutionary Algorithm)** library for evolutionary computations. The main goal is to define grammars, infer patterns, and evaluate their fitness against a target dataset.

## Features

1. **Grammar-Based Pattern Representation**:
   - Custom grammars for pattern representation.
   - Generation of bounded and unbounded grammars.
2. **Target Sequence Generator**:
   - Extracts target patterns from event streams based on predefined conditions.
3. **Fitness Evaluation**:
   - Matches inferred patterns with target patterns and computes fitness using precision, recall, and FÎ² scores.
4. **Genetic Algorithm Integration**:
   - Evolves pattern representations to maximize fitness.
5. **Apache Flink Integration**:
   - Supports high-performance, distributed event processing.
