# Flink CEP Patter generation with Genetic Algorithms
This project leverages Apache Flink's Complex Event Processing (CEP) library for real-time event pattern detection, coupled with genetic algorithms to optimize these patterns. The main goal is to allow users to define, apply, and evolve event patterns for data stream analysis.

## Features

- **Pattern Grammar**: Define flexible event patterns with quantifiers, concatenators, and conditions.
- **Pattern Representation**: Model patterns in Java through the `PatternRepresentation` class, including:
  - **Events**: Defined by identifiers, conditions, and quantifiers.
  - **Conditions**: Specify attributes to filter events.
  - **Within Clause**: Set a maximum time window for matching sequences.
- **CEP Integration**: Convert pattern representations to Apache Flink patterns and apply them to data streams.
- **Genetic Algorithm Optimization**: Use genetic algorithms to evolve and optimize pattern detection.

## Project Structure

- **Pattern Grammar**: Defines a grammar for creating event patterns in a tree structure.
- **TreeToRepresentationMapper**: Maps tree-based patterns to the `PatternRepresentation` Java model.
- **RepresentationToPatternMapper**: Converts `PatternRepresentation` objects to Apache Flink `Pattern` objects.
- **Flink CEP Integration**: Uses the `Pattern` API to apply patterns on data streams and trigger alerts on pattern matches.
- **Genetic Algorithm (jGEA)**: Optimizes patterns based on user-defined fitness functions.
